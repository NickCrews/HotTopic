notes:

4/2:
started a run on mcscn at 11:30 on augmented data, called convWithAugmentedBig.h5
8 per epoch, 128 epochs

started a run on mcscn at noon on augmented data, called convWithAugmentedBigger.h5
16 per epoch, 256 epochs

4/3:
5pm
made it so augmenting pads the starting layers so we don't crop useful stuff when rotating or scaling. now re-ran the preProcessor fit so that it fits on the new kind of augmented data, since it contains a lot more zeros now, so the mean and std dev are often different

4/4:
now we have 3 steps: augmenting, pre-processing to get data in final matrix, then normalization.

4/5:
finished the weather compatibility and trained for 64 epochs, batchSize=16. It predicts nothing ever burns.
I think this is because only ~5% of pixels actually did burn, so it just always say nothing burns


4/7:
Trying to fix this imbalance issue.
